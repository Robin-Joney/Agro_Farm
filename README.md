1.4 SOFTWARE FEATURES
About PHP
	PHP is a powerful server-side scripting language for creating dynamic and interactive websites. PHP widely used; free and efficient alternative to competitors such as Microsoft’s ASP.PHP is perfectly suited for Web development and can be embedded directly into the HTML code. The PHP syntax is similar to pearl and C.
	PHP is open source that it is readily available and absolutely free. Stability, flexibility and speed are chief qualities that attract to choose PHP.PHP have multiple extensions and is extremely scalable. 
Server-side scripting
	This server-side scripting is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. Programmer needs three things to make this work. Programmer need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. Programmer can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHO page through the server. All these can run on your home machine if programmers are just experimenting with PHP programming.
Command line scripting
	Programmer can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. Programmers only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using croon (on*nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks.
Features of PHP
	PHP runs on different platforms (Windows, Linux, UNIX, etc.)
	PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today.
	PHP is free to download from the official PHP resource: www.php.net.
About MYSQL
MYSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) is developed, distributed and supported by MYSQL AB. MYSQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications MYSQL can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware, such as a multi-processor server with gigabytes of memory. MYSQL is easy to use, yet extremely powerful, secure, and scalable. And because of its small size and speed, it is the ideal database solution for Web sites.  
MYSQL is a database management system
A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amount of information in a corporation network. To add, access and process data stored in a computer database we need a database management system such as MYSQL server. Since computers are very good at handling large amount of data, database management system plays a central role in computing.
MYSQL is a relational database management system
 	A relational database stores separate data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big storeroom. This adds speed and flexibility. The SQL part of “MYSQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common standardize language used to access database and is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL standard. The SQL standard has been evolving since 1986 and several versions exist.
MYSQL software is open source
Open source means that it is possible for anyone to use modify the software. Anybody can download the MYSQL software uses the GPL (GNU General Public License), to define what we may and may not use do with the software. 
MYSQL Server works in Client/ Server or embedded systems
The MYSQL database software is a client/server system that consists of a multi-threaded SQL server that supports different backend, several different client programs and libraries, administrative tools and a wide range of Application Programming Interface(APIs). A large amount of contributed MYSQL software is available:
 Modern day websites seem to be relying more and more on compel the Structured Query Language is a very popular database language, and its standardization makes it easy to store, update and access data. One of the most powerful SQL servers out there is called MYSQL and surprisingly enough, it’s free.
Some of the features of MYSQL include: Handles large databases, in the area of 50,000,000+records. No memory leaks. Tested with a commercial memory leakage detector (purify). A privilege and password system which is very flexible and secure, and which allows host-based verification. Passwords are secure since all password traffic when connecting the server is encrypted.

Features of MYSQL
Client/server Architecture: MYSQL is a client/server system. There is a database server (MYSQL) and arbitrarily many clients (application programs), which communicate with the server. The clients can run on the same computer as the server or on another computer.
SQL Compatibility: As before said SQL is a standardized language for querying and updating data and for the administration of a database. Through the configuration setting sol-mode we can make the MYSQL server behave for the most part compatibly with various database systems.
Stored procedures: Stored procedures (SPs for short) are generally used to simplify steps such as inserting or deleting a data record. 
Triggers: Triggers are SQL commands that are automatically executed by the server in certain database operations INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, MYSQL has supported triggers. 
            Replication: Replication allows the contents of a database to be copied (replicated) onto a number of computers to increase protection against system and to improve the speed of database queries.
      	Platform independence: MYSQL can be executed under a number of operating systems. The most important are Apple Macintosh OS X, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and the Unix.
Speed: MYSQL is considered a very fast database program.









2. SYSTEM STUDY
2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
In present system every farmer product selling system work such as sales and view farmer product information is carried out manually. The present system is much time consuming. Hence for that more human resource is needed and a huge amount of time is needed for it. In present system user have to walk in market to get correct price of the product and get the product. This system does not have any facilities to view item price and order of item. The main drawbacks of the existing system farmer have to go market for sell their farmer product this is more tedious task to farmer.
2.1.1 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISITNG SYSTEM
	Time consuming process.
	Needs of man power.
	Difficult to get item information.
	Farmer to sell agri product is very difficult.
	Every time they have to go market to sell a product.

The drawbacks, which are faced during existing system, can be eradicated by using the farmer product dealing system. The main objective of the proposed system is to provide a user-friendly interface. The system, which is proposed, now computerizes all the processes involved in farmer product. Project proposes a new technique to farmer can sell the item in this application farmer can arrange an order of the item with a certain time limit.
2.2.1 ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
	This application will reduce manual work and maintain updates in database from time to time.
	Less time consuming process.
	Easy way to get item information and price details.
	Farmer to sell agri product is very easiest way.
	No need to go market to sell a product.
	Easy report generation.
3. SYSTEM DESIGN
3.1 INPUT DESIGN
Input design is one of the most expensive phases of  the  operation  of  computerized  system  and  is  often  the  major  problem  of  a  system. A large number of problems with a system can usually be tracked backs to fault input design and method. Needless  to  say,  therefore, that the input data is the life blood  of  a  system  and  have  to  be  analyzed  and  designed with utmost case and consideration. The decisions made during the input designer.
3.2 DATABASE DESIGN
The database design involves creation of tables that are represented in physical database as stored files. They have their own existence. Each table constitute of rows and columns where each row can be viewed as record that consists of related information and column can be viewed as field of data of same type. The table is also designed with some position can have a null value. The database design of project is designed in such a way values are kept without redundancy and with normalized format. Refer the appendix for screen shots of database design.

3.3 CODE DESIGN
       Code is an order collection of symbols designed to provide unique identification of an entry or attribute. Sometimes used in the place of name of the item they can be specified all object’s physical or performances characteristics or operational instructions. They can also show inter relationship and may sometime be used to achieve secrecy or confidentiality.
Code design submit the user id, farmer id, product id and order id generate the unique form design.
3.4 OUTPUT DESIGN
	The output design must be in such a way the user must able to understand the given details. So each detail given in the output should have some meaning in displaying the data. The output design is displayed in the form of data view. Output Design generally refers to  the  results  and  information’s  that  are  generated  by  the system for many end-users, output is the main reason  for  developing  the  system  and  the basis on which  they  evaluate  the  usefulness  of  the  application. The objective of a system finds its shape in terms of the output. The analysis of the objective of a system leads to determination of outputs. External outputs are those whose destination will be outside the organization and which  require  special  attention  as  they  project  the  image  of  the  organization. Internal outputs are those whose destination is within the organization. It is to be carefully designed as they are the user’s main interface with the system.

4. SYSTEM TESTING AND IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 SYSTEM TESTING
Testing is carried out after the development of the proposed system. The principle activity of system development is preparing the source code. In this system the source code is developed for each module separately. The source code is prepared for master files and they are compiled and corrected. Then the source code for the transaction files are prepared, compiled and corrected. Then the modules are combined and corrected as a whole module.
A strategy for software testing must accommodate low-level tests that are necessary to verify that all small source code segments has been correctly implemented as well as high-level tests that validate major system functions against customer requirements. Testing is a process of executing program with the intent of finding error. A good test case is one that has high probability of finding an undiscovered error. If testing is conducted successfully it uncovers the errors in the software. Testing cannot show the absence of defects, it can only show that software defects present. Test configuration includes test plan and test cases and test tools.
TESTING OBJECTIVES
Software Testing has different goals and objectives. The major objectives of Software testing are as follows:
	Finding defects which may get created by the programmer while developing the software.
	Gaining confidence in and providing information about the level of quality. 
	To prevent defects. 
	To make sure that the end result meets the business and user requirements. 
	To ensure that it satisfies the BRS that is Business Requirement Specification and SRS that is System Requirement Specifications. 
	To gain the confidence of the customers by providing them a quality product
Testing methodologies
Testing methodologies are the strategies and approaches used to test a particular product to ensure it is fit for purpose. Testing methodologies usually involve testing that the product works in accordance with its specification, has no undesirable side effects when used in ways outside of its design parameters and worst case will fail-safely (e.g. a nuclear reactor will shut down on failure).

 Unit testing
	Unit testing is essential for the verification of the code produced during the coding phase and hence the goal is to test the internal logic of the modules. Using the detailed design description as a guide, important paths are tested to uncover errors within the boundary of the modules. These tests were carried out during the programming stage itself.
Integration testing
Integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the program structure while at the same time conducting tests to uncover error associated within the interface. The objective is to take unit tested modules and build a program structure that has been dictated by design. All modules are combined in this step. The entire program is tested as whole. And chaos in interfaces may usually result. A set of errors is encountered in such a case.
Validation testing
Here in the validation testing we want to check whether the given conditions to the text box are working correctly. Because in the name place we want to enter the characters and the special symbols only we should not enter the numbers in the name field. Here while on runtime we entered numeric values in the string specified columns of product inwards. It raises error. In this phase each module has been tested by wrong inputs, for example Employee Name should be a character as well as their age should be in numbers.
Functional testing
The functional testing part of a testing methodology is typically broken down into four components - unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing – usually executed in this order. Entire system is working properly or not will be tested here, and specified path connection IS correct or not, and giving output or not are tested here these verifications and validations are done by giving input values to the system and by comparing with expected output.
4.2 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation is the stage in the project where the theoretical design is turned into a working system and is giving confidence on the new system for the users that it will work efficiently and effectively. It involves careful planning, investigation of the current system and its constraints on implementation, design of methods to achieve the change over, an evaluation of change over methods. Apart from planning major task of preparing the implementation are education and training of users. The implementation process begins with preparing a plan for the implementation of the system. 
According to this plan, the activities are to be carried out, discussions made regarding the equipment and resources and the additional equipment has to be acquired to implement the new system. In network backup system no additional resources are needed. Implementation is the final and the most important phase. The most critical stage in achieving a successful new system is giving the users confidence that the new system will work and be effective. The system can be implemented only after thorough testing is done and if it is found to be working according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest security since the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle certain type of transactions while using the new system. As the part of system testing we execute the program with the intent of finding errors and missing operations and also a complete verification to determine whether the objectives are met and the user requirements are satisfied. The ultimate aim is quality assurance.
4.3 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE
According to this plan, the activities are to be carried out, discussions made regarding the equipment and resources and the additional equipment has to be acquired to implement the new system. In network backup system no additional resources are needed. Implementation is the final and the most important phase. The most critical stage in achieving a successful new system is giving the users confidence that the new system will work and be effective. The system can be implemented only after thorough testing is done and if it is found to be working according to the specification. This method also offers the greatest security since the old system can take over if the errors are found or inability to handle certain type of transactions while using the new system. As the part of system testing we execute the program with the intent of finding errors and missing operations and also a complete verification to determine whether the objectives are met and the user requirements are satisfied. The ultimate aim is quality assurance.





5. CONCLUSION
     	The application works according to the restrictions provided in their respective browsers. The application satisfies the Admin. The speed of the transactions become more enough now. The website creation is the web designing project created for displaying the details about the web portal using the coding languages like Html & Css for designing. The interface are so designed and channeled the admin can never make any mistake while using the application, till the time either they save or cancel the current operation all other operations are blocked.  This project has been successfully developed and interpreted and system was developed according to the admin requirements. The system produces accurate results and it also reduces a lot of overheads, which the manual system faced. The information requirements may still increase. 
 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
There is a wide scope for future development of the software. The world of computer fields is not static it is always subject to change. The technology which is famous today will become outdated very next day. To keep abstract of technical improvements, the system may be refinement. So it is not concluded. Yet it will improve with further enhancements.
It is essential to change the software when new software arrives with more advanced feathers. So it is much necessary for further development. Further enhancements can be done in an efficient manner with disruption to the system.
